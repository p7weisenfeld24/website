<p>
	Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor of the 19th Century.Tesla's most notable 
<br/> acheivment is hisdiscovery and polularization of Alternating Current(A/C).He worked
<br/> for a short time with Thomas Edison before going out on his own. He then worked with
<br/> Westinghouse to compete with Edison and his Direct Current(D/C).

<p>
I admire Tesla because he came from a normal background and was the first in his family
<br/>to study science. It was because of Tesla's innovations that or technology has advanced 
<br/> to where it is today. If Edison's DC remained as the standard current, our progress
<br/> in technology would be behind where it is today.
